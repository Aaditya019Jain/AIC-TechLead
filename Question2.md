source Validation:
Implement a mechanism to validate the credibility of the sources from which the information is retrieved. You can utilize APIs or web scraping techniques to extract metadata such as domain authority, publication date, and reputation scores.
Establish a whitelist of trusted sources or domains from which the chatbot can fetch information. Exclude sources known for spreading misinformation or low-quality content.



Accommodating new data as it becomes available is crucial for ensuring that your language model (LM) remains up-to-date and continues to perform well over time. Here are some strategies you can consider to incorporate new data into your LM training pipeline:

1. **Incremental Training**:
   - Implement a system for incremental training, where new data is periodically added to the existing training dataset, and the LM is retrained on the combined dataset.
   - Use techniques like online learning or mini-batch training to efficiently incorporate new data without having to retrain the entire model from scratch.

2. **Fine-tuning**:
   - Fine-tune the existing LM using new data whenever it becomes available. Fine-tuning involves updating the parameters of the LM based on the new data while retaining the knowledge learned from previous training.
   - Fine-tuning can be performed on a smaller subset of the new data or on specific tasks or domains of interest.

4. **Active Learning**:
   - Implement an active learning framework where the LM is periodically evaluated on new data, and instances that are most informative or uncertain are selected for manual annotation or verification.
   - Incorporate the annotated data into the training pipeline to improve the LM's performance on specific tasks or domains.

5. **Transfer Learning**:
   - Leverage transfer learning techniques to adapt the pre-trained LM to new tasks or domains using limited amounts of new data.
   - Fine-tune the LM on a task-specific dataset or use techniques like domain adaptation to transfer knowledge from the pre-trained LM to the new task or domain.

6. **Version Control**:
   - Maintain version control of your training data and models to keep track of changes over time and ensure reproducibility.
   - Document the sources and characteristics of new data added to the training pipeline to facilitate analysis and evaluation of the LM's performance.

7. **Automated Pipelines**:
   - Set up automated pipelines for data collection, preprocessing, training, and evaluation to streamline the process of incorporating new data into the LM training pipeline.
   - Monitor the performance of the LM over time and trigger retraining or fine-tuning processes based on predefined criteria or thresholds.

By incorporating these strategies into your LM training pipeline, you can effectively accommodate new data as it becomes available, ensuring that your LM remains up-to-date and continues to perform well over time.
